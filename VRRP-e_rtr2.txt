!I have configured two virtual IP addresses in the same subnet on a single interface in each of two routers.  
!This configuration could be used for load sharing in a subnet.  Suppose half of the hosts hanging off this 
!interface pair use .254 as a DG, and the other half use .253.  Under normal operating conditions, Router1 
!is the DG for the .254 group and Router2 is the DG for the .253 group.  If either goes down, the affected 
!group merely switches to the other router.
!
!Track port is not mandatory.
