!I have configured two virtual IP addresses in the same subnet on a single interface in each of two routers.  
!This configuration could be used for load sharing in a subnet.  Suppose half of the hosts hanging off this 
!interface pair use .254 as a DG, and the other half use .253.  Under normal operating conditions, Router1 
!is the DG for the .254 group and Router2 is the DG for the .253 group.  If either goes down, the affected 
!group merely switches to the other router.

!Track port is not mandatory.  

router vrrp-extended
interface ethernet 1/6
 ip address 192.53.5.2/24
 ip vrrp-extended vrid 1
  backup priority 110 track-priority 20
  track-port ethernet 2/4
  ip-address 192.53.5.254
  activate
  !VRRP router 1 for this interface is activating
  exit
interface ethernet 1/6
 Router1(config-if-e10000-1/6)# ip vrrp-extended vrid 2
  Router1(config-if-e10000-1/6-vrid-1)# backup priority 100 track-priority 20
  Router1(config-if-e10000-1/6-vrid-1)# track-port ethernet 2/4
  Router1(config-if-e10000-1/6-vrid-1)# ip-address 192.53.5.253
  Router1(config-if-e10000-1/6-vrid-1)# activate
  !VRRP router 2 for this interface is activating
!NOTE
!The address you enter with the ip-address command cannot be the same as a real IP address
!configured on the interface.
